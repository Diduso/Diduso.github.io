# Search for Mulch Diggums
Mulch Diggums is a kleptomanic dwarf in the Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfer.  
He is from the underground but he broke up with a "normal" life there and creates insecurity for all sort of expensive jewelry, art or noble metal.  

## Character traits:
* rough
* humorous
* comradely
* likeable

His rough manner and humor creates a vivacious character. Despite  of his very active criminal activities it makes the reader feel with him.  

He is an expert in his branche and famous for his tunneling skills: He can dislocate his jaw so he is able "eat" through the ground at enormous speed. But while tunneling, some gas contained in the earth retains in his stomach. When he releases this air, please avoid standing behind him. His powerful flatulences knocked already many people off, even Butler.  
As if this is not enough his beard hair, spit and skin pores offer extraordinary abilities, useful for bulgary like they were made for it.
Therefore he is almost the perfect burglar and an exceptional phenomenon. He becomes friends with Artemis Fowl and fascinates his criminal mind.
His horrible smell and extreme sun-sensitivity should not be forgotten.
